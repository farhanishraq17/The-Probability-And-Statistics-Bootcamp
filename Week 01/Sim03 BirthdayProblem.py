#Running the script with trials = 100000 will give 
#simulated probabilities close to the exact ones; they converge as trials grows.

#For n = 23 you should see something around 0.507 (the exact: â‰ˆ0.507297).

#The sweep will report n = 23 as the smallest 
#number of people with at least a 50% chance of a shared birthday.
